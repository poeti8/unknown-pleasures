## run locally

you need [node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager. (npm should work fine too).

1. install dependencies via `pnpm install` or `npm install`.
2. run the app via `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev`.
3. visit `http://localhost:5173/unknown-pleasures`

this is my first experience with the mentioned technologies in an attempt to learn 3d web graphics. you might see some hacky wacky stuff in the code since i don't really know what i'm doing.
